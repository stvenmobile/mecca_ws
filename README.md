##  <a name='SystemOverview'></a>System Overview
- The **STM32 controller board** listens on the serial port for motor commands from the Raspberry Pi.
- The STM32 also uses a **PID algorithm** to maintain precise speeds for accurate navigation.
- The **Raspberry Pi** accepts joystick commands for movement but **filters user inputs** with safety overrides based on data from the VL53L1X range sensor for **obstacle avoidance**.

##  <a name='ChassisandConstruction'></a>Chassis and Construction
- The **aluminum chassis and mecanum wheels** were obtained from HiWonder as part of this kit:
  - *Hiwonder Large Metal 4WD Vehicle Chassis for Arduino/Raspberry Pi/ROS Robot with 12V Encoder Geared Motor* https://www.hiwonder.com/products/large-metal-4wd-vehicle-chassis-green
- The motors were later replaced with **Yahboom JGB37-520 motors** for better integration with the STM32 board.https://category.yahboom.net/products/md520
- Additional **3D-printed components** were added to extend the chassis to llok like a truck cab and provide mounting for additional components.
- The cab is split into two components to fit on a 255mm square print bed.
- Two strips of 20x20 aluminum extrusion 24cm long are botled to the top of the chassis at each side to secure the 3D printed truck cab front and back.
- The robot controller board is mounted under the aluminum chassis along with the four DC motors.
- The Raspberry Pi, DPDT Switch, Voltage Meter, banana jack and 5200 mAh LiPo battery are4 mounted inside the 3d printed cab. 
- The 7 segment RGB strip is mounted in a cutout slot in the cab top.
- The VL53L1X sensor is mounted in the front part of the cab in a special cutout and secured with two M3 bolts.
- An A1 RPLIDAR unit can optionally be bolted to the cab top flat section as shown in the images folder.

## Wiring
![Controller Board ](images/YB-ERF01-V3.0.png)
### 1. The Deans connector is connected to the center poles of the DPDT Rocker Switch. 
### 4. The Micro USB connector is connected to one of the USB ports on the Raspberry Pi.
### 5. The USB-C connector on the controller board is connected to the USB-C power input jack on the Raspberry Pi 5.
### 6. The 5v barrel jack output is connected to the Vin and GND for the WS2812 RGB LED strip.
### 10. The power switch on the ocntroller board is left in the ON position.
### 20. The four motors are connected via 6-condutor cables to the four motor jacks. The motors are connected as shown in the diagram below.

###  <a name='VL53L1XTime-of-FlightToFSensorWiringI2C'></a> VL53L1X Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensor Wiring (I2C) <!-- omit in toc -->
The **VL53L1X ToF sensor** communicates via **I2C** and is connected as follows:

| **VL53L1X Pin** | **Raspberry Pi 5 Pin** | **Function** |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **VCC** | Pin **1** (3.3V) or Pin **2/4** (5V) | Power Supply |
| **GND** | Pin **6** (GND) | Ground |
| **SDA** | Pin **3** (GPIO2 - I2C SDA) | I2C Data |
| **SCL** | Pin **5** (GPIO3 - I2C SCL) | I2C Clock |
| **XSHUT** *(optional)* | Any GPIO (e.g., GPIO17 - Pin 11) | Enable/Disable Sensor |
| **GPIO1 (Interrupt)** *(optional)* | Any GPIO (e.g., GPIO27 - Pin 13) | Interrupt Signal |

- **Power Selection:** The sensor supports **both 3.3V and 5V**. If using 3.3V logic, connect to **Pin 1** (3.3V).
- **XSHUT Pin:** If controlled via software, connect it to a GPIO. Otherwise, pull it **high** to enable the sensor.
- **GPIO1 Interrupt:** Used if interrupt-based sensor reading is needed.

###  <a name='WS28127-LightRGBLEDStripWiringSPI'></a> WS2812 7-Light RGB LED Strip Wiring (SPI)  <!-- omit in toc -->
The **WS2812 LED strip** is controlled via **SPI Bus 0**, using the following connections:

| **WS2812 Pin** | **Raspberry Pi 5 Pin** | **Function** |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **VCC** | Pin **2** or **4** (5V) | Power Supply |
| **GND** | Pin **6** (GND) | Ground |
| **DIN** (Data In) | Pin **19** (GPIO10 - SPI0 MOSI) | SPI Data Line |

- **Data Line Control:** The LED strip **receives data via SPI0 MOSI (GPIO10, Pin 19)** instead of a standard GPIO-PWM method.
- **Level Shifting:** Ensure the LED strip operates at **5V logic**, as the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO runs at **3.3V**.
- **Power Requirements:** Each LED can draw **~60mA** at full brightness. Ensure your power supply can handle the total current demand.

Here is a pictorial diagram of the wiring to the Raspberry Pi 5:

####  <a name='ConfigurationSettings'></a>Configuration Settings
- **I2C/SPI Configuration:** If I2C or SPI is disabled, enable them via:
  ```bash
  sudo raspi-config
  ```

- Navigate to Interface Options > I2C or SPI > Enable.

##  <a name='HowtoUse'></a>How to Use
1. **Power on the robot** and ensure the STM32 controller is connected to the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Run the ROS2 launch file** to start all necessary nodes:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch mecca_ws mecca_bringup.launch.py
3. Alternatively, start the launch file as a system service.
4. **Use a joystick** to control the robot, or allow it to navigate autonomously.
4. The LED strip will reflect motion state changes with different light effects.
6. Joystick controls:
